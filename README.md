# EventScraperJP
WebScraper for https://t.pia.jp/ and https://l-tike.com/ and https://eplus.jp/ and https://zaiko.io/


Python + Flask + JS with Electron + HTML + Tailwind CSS (Play CDN)

Scraping eplus.jp is laggy due to the website's constrains (tldr: if it goes any faster the website will die all together).

Should work on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Project made with love for a Uni course by Mast.
Thank you Lange, Spi and others for all the help.

If you need a command to rebuild the app RebuildCommand.txt!
